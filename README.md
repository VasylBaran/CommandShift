# CommandShift
CommandShift is a free and open-source app that allows you to change input source using Windows-style shortcut (e.g. Command + Shift, Option + Shift, Control + Shift or Fn + Shift. It's customizable). By default MacOS doesn't support shortcuts that consist of modifier keys only.

# How-to use
1. Download Intel or ARM64(aka M1) dmg
2. Drag'n'drop CommandShift application from dmg-file to your Applications folder
3. Add CommandShift to "Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility" in order for it to work properly
4. Enjoy!
5. (optionally) Add CommandShift to your startup items ("Users & Groups -> Login Items")

# FAQ:
* Q: I've added CommandShift to "Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility" but it doesn't work =(
* A: Please make sure that your settings in "Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Input Sources" are set to default (you can easily do that by pressing "Restore Defaults" button there)
* Q: How do I choose which shortcut should switch language?
* A: Find CommandShift ('CS' icon) in menu bar at the top-right and click on it, there you'll find "Change language with..." drop-down. Select the one you prefer =) 
* Q: I get "CommandShift is damaged and can't be opened" error
* A: Please run this command in Terminal: _xattr -cr /Applications/CommandShift.app_
* Q: How to automatically launch CommandShift when computer starts?
* A: You can add CommandShift to your list of auto-start items by opening System Settings panel -> Users and Groups OR General (depending on what version of macOS you're using) -> Login Items -> [+] -> [select CommandShift app]

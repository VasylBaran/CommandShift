# CommandShift
CommandShift is a free and open-source app that allows you to change input source using Windows-style (Command + Shift) shortcut. By default MacOS doesn't support shortcuts that consist of modifier keys only.

# How-to use
1. Download Intel or ARM64(aka M1) dmg
2. Drag'n'drop CommandShift application from dmg-file to your Applications folder
3. Add CommandShift to "Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility" in order for it to work properly
4. Enjoy!
5. (optionally) Add CommandShift to your startup items ("Users & Groups -> Login Items")

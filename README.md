# Backstory
Initially I wrote this program for myself since I bought my first Macbook and quickly realized that I can't use 'Alt'+Shift to change language on macOS. 
After a while a friend of mine bought his first Macbook and asked me "How can I change language using 'Alt'+Shift? I can't seem to change it in system preferences". I shared my app with him and at that point I realized that other people might find it useful as well so decided to share this app with the world.

# CommandShift
CommandShift is a free and open-source app that allows you to change input source using Windows-style shortcut (e.g. Command + Shift, Option + Shift, Control + Shift, Fn + Shift or even just Shift. It's quite customizable). 
By default MacOS doesn't support shortcuts that consist of modifier keys only. CommandShift solves this problem.

# Support 
I'm a single software engineer from Ukraine.

It encourages me to further improve, support and update CommandShift as new versions of MacOS come out. 

**My current goal is $99 which is a membership fee for Apple Developer program** so that I can propertly sign and notarize CommandShift using Apple developer certificate.
